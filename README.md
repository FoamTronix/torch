Torch
======

This repo contains plans for building a torch similar to that of the Minecraft torch, but more awesome :-).


# Materials

There are many different materials to build this torch out of, but our focus is on building them out of DollarTree Foam board (20x30-in. Readi-Board Foam Boards).  The foam board from the DollarTree (or similar stores) is very easy to work with, cut, and peel away the paper layers as needed.  It also easily allows for kids of any age to get involved using the skills they have picked up in school; glue, gluestick, pencils, colored pencils, crayons, scissors, ruler, measure, cut, etc.


# Custom Parts

In the [custom_parts folder](https://github.com/FoamTronix/torch/tree/master/custom_parts) are files to import into the Fritzing project.
